# Dart Learning Path

This repository contains resources for learning Dart programming, covering beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.

## Beginner Level:

**Introduction to Dart**

- What is Dart?
  Imagine a friendly robot helping you build amazing things on the web and mobile! That's what Dart is like. It's a programming language created by Google, designed to be easy to learn and powerful for building apps. Here's the gist:

Like Lego blocks: Dart code is made of blocks called lines of code, which you put together to create programs.
Friendly commands: Instead of cryptic words, Dart uses simple instructions like print and if to tell your program what to do.
Fast and efficient: Dart programs run smoothly without slowing down your devices.
One code fits all: Write your app once in Dart, and it works on almost any device - phones, tablets, computers, you name it!
History and Evolution of Dart:


- History and evolution of Dart

  
Dart wasn't born yesterday. It was released in 2011 by Google with a mission to make app development enjoyable and accessible. Since then, it's grown and evolved with new features and tools to make your coding life easier. Think of it as a helpful friend constantly getting better at helping you build awesome things!


- Setting up Dart development environment
  
Getting started with Dart is a breeze! There are two main ways:

Online Playground: Try Dart instantly in your web browser! Visit https://dartpad.dev/: https://dartpad.dev/ and start playing with code right away. It's like a virtual sandbox where you can experiment without installing anything.
Download Dart SDK: Want more power and flexibility? Download the Dart SDK (https://dart.dev/get-dart: https://dart.dev/get-dart/) for your computer. It's like getting a bigger toolbox with more features to create amazing apps.
Ready for an adventure? These are just the first steps on your Dart journey. Don't worry if things seem unfamiliar at first. Learning any new skill takes time and practice, but Dart is here to be your friendly companion every step of the way!

**Basic Syntax and Data Types**

- Variables and constants
- Data types (int, double, String, bool)
- Operators and expressions

**Control Flow and Functions**
  
- Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions and parameters

**Collections and Iterables**
 
- Lists, sets, and maps
- Iterating through collections
- List manipulation methods
  
**Object-Oriented Programming**
  
-  Classes and objects
-   Inheritance and polymorphism
-   Constructors and methods


Certainly! Here's a detailed roadmap for learning Dart from beginner to advanced level:
